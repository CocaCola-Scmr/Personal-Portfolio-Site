        <p>
          At the FoundersHack 2025 hackathon, I teamed up with three others to
          develop a mens skincare recommendation app within a tight 72-hour
          window. Skintelligence allows men to quickly find the right skincare
          products for them based on thier individual needs and goals, sifting
          through the infamously confusing ingredient lists and misleading
          marketing so they don't have to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following the initial landing page, the app features a quiz style
          interface that gathers user specific information such as skin types,
          skin problems, shaving frequency, climate, and many more factors that
          can affect skincare. Using this information our algorithm then
          determines the most suitable products, showing a screen with the top 3
          personalised recommendations. Users can then sign up for a trial, that
          delivers free samples of the recommended products straight to thier
          doorsteps.

        <p>
          As part of the DevSoc Trainee Program, I worked with 4 other people to
          create a collaborative study platform called StudyPal. With StudyPal,
          users can create groups with their friends and track each others
          progress and tasks completed for a particular project. This ensures
          student's stay motivated, adding a competitive element which can
          prevent procrastination.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was tasked with designing and developing most of the front end,
          using React JS.

          Note: Some of the images for phones don't work as they use expired
          links
        </p>
        <p>
          Through Gadget Compass, users looking for a new smartphone were able
          to determine which options were best for them by answering a few
          questions on what they were looking for in their new device. For
          example, what screen size or battery life they desired.
