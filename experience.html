            <h3>Coding and Robotics Educator</h3>
            <p id="date">February 2024 - Present</p>
            <p>As a coding and robotics educator, I teach new programming concepts to K – 6 children, using coding robots and programs like Scratch. I've had a great time so far, getting pretty good at explaining new concepts in a straightforward, concise and understandable manner. I also helped students cultivate some of the soft skills required in a STEM focused environment, including teamwork, communication and problem solving. Due to the nature of my role, I believe the skills I've picked up would make me a great fit for the DevSoc Trainee Program!</p>

            <p>Look, working at McDonalds isn't exactly the most glamorous job, but it's taught me alot of things - I've gotten better at working working with others to coordinate tasks, learning new skills and processes, following the company's strict guidelines, etc - especially in a high pressure, fast paced environment where it was vital to maintain quality and composure. And I think these skills I developed would all be pretty useful for any role, including a DevSoc trainee!</p>

            <h3>Team Member (Work Experience Program)</h3>
            <p id="date">May 2021</p>
            <p>In 2021, I worked as a team member at Gadget Xperts, a mobile repair shop where I first gained experience in a retail setting. It was honestly pretty satisfying getting to professionally do what I spent most of my life doing for friends and family anyway - tech support! During my time, I learnt and refined skills like problem solving, communication, and customer service. Whether it was fixing devices for customers, determining their specific needs and issues, or simply making them feel welcome, I discovered that I’d excel in any role in tech.</p>
